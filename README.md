# Darkmatter

Custom color scheme for Sublime Text 3. And 2, I guess. Probably.

### Themes

#### Darkmatter

Originally based on Patrick Muller's [Darkmatter](https://github.com/patrickemuller/Sublime-Darkmatter-Theme), itself based on [TronLight](http://colorsublime.com/theme/TronLight) and [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray).

### How to Install

#### Manually (since it isn't on Package Control)

1. [Download the .zip](https://github.com/charlesharries/Sublime-Dark-Matter-Theme/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip and rename the folder to `Theme - Darkmatter`
3. Copy the folder into `Packages` directory, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...`

***

### How to Activate

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>,</kbd> on Mac).

You can choose whichever flavor you like, but don't forget to change *both* color scheme and UI theme so they match.

***Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.***

### Special Thanks to

Patrick Muller, creator of the Darkmatter theme that this theme is based on, and...

Creator of [TronLight Theme](http://colorsublime.com/theme/TronLight) theme, which I think came before Darkmatter, and [Gadzhi Kharkharov](https://github.com/kkga) for creating the [Space Gray Theme](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) that I believe came even before that.
